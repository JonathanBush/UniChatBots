# UniChatBots
This is the place where I'll be experimenting with making UniChat Bots. As of right now, I have two bots that are up on UniChat. 

### FriendlyBOT
[user]o/

**FriendlyBOT waves back at user

### roomBOT
[user]#spam

[roomBOT]Here's the link: https://legend-of-iphoenix.github.io/UniChatDemo/?room=spam

## Bots in progress

### BanBot
You can fake ban or kick someone

### jcgterBOT
Lots of different commands

### DoorsCE
Taken from both jcgterBOT and DoorsCS, mainly because jcgterBOT wouldn't work. It's activated diffrently, though.
